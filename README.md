#Team-Stats-Tool
This project is designed to input, clean, and process statistics for a basketball team. The program will display a menu with the option to display each team's statistics or exit the program. The statistics are displayed in a cleaned format. Additionally, the program will organize players into balanced teams based on their experience level.
This project helped me learn and showcase skills in inputting and cleaning data from files, handling errors and invalid inputs, and utilizing dictionaries.
